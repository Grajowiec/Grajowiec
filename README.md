### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Just a gamer that likes to go "fine, I'll do it myself" and mod the game to his vision. Currently studies computer science in [WSZIB](https://www.wszib.edu.pl/) Cracow.
Mostly interested in modding games, when doing something privately it's mostly in C# or C++. 
Also greatly interested in Operating Systems and actually likes Windows.
